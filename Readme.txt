Thank you for reviewing the supplemental materials for our research paper. Below are the instructions for running the IPython notebooks.

Setup Instructions:

    Launch Jupyter Notebook: Navigate to the folder containing the notebooks and run:

    jupyter notebook

    This will open a new tab in your web browser displaying the Jupyter interface.

    Open the notebooks: From the Jupyter dashboard, click on the notebook you wish to run (the .ipynb files).

    Running the notebook:
        Cells in the notebook can be executed one at a time by selecting a cell and clicking the "Run" button, or by pressing Shift + Enter.
        Make sure to run the cells in order to ensure the code executes correctly, especially for loading data or setting variables.

Notes:

    Some notebooks may require specific input files or datasets.
